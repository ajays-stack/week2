# Week2
💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting key water quality indicators through machine learning models. Developed as part of a one-month virtual internship under AICTE and sponsored by Shell, it showcases how data science can support environmental sustainability.

🌍 Project Objective
Clean water is essential for public health and environmental protection. This project explores a predictive approach to estimate multiple water quality parameters simultaneously, enabling faster detection of contamination and informed decision-making.

🚀 What This Project Does
📥 Loads and processes real-world water quality data
🧠 Applies multi-target regression techniques
🌲 Utilizes Random Forest wrapped in a MultiOutputRegressor
📊 Evaluates predictions using standard regression metrics
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python 3.12
Libraries:
pandas, numpy – for data handling
scikit-learn – for model development and evaluation
matplotlib, seaborn – for visualization
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
🔢 Parameters Predicted
The machine learning model estimates multiple chemical properties of water, including:

Ammonium (NH₄)
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5 / BSK5)
Colloids
Dissolved Oxygen (O₂)
Nitrate (NO₃)
Nitrite (NO₂)
Sulfate (SO₄)
Phosphate (PO₄)
Chloride (Cl⁻)
📈 Model Insights
The model’s accuracy and generalization were measured using:

R² Score – measures the proportion of variance explained
Mean Squared Error (MSE) – highlights prediction error
The results showed satisfactory performance across all predicted targets.
